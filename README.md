# Monsters Rolodex

This project is built for checking current exchange rates directly from the EU Central Bank. I used to great REST API:
1. [Foreign Exchange API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/);
2. [Country Flags API](https://www.countryflags.io/);

It is deployed on Github Pages and this is the [link](https://uptheirons78.github.io/exchange-rates).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
